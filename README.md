### Hi! Thanks for visiting. 

What you will find here are set of experiments with dynamic, temporally-coherent recurrent neural networks. I was fortunate to work on this with my friend JB Melander. 

models.py, init_net.py, and optimizers.py, respecitvley, contains various reservoir-models, allows for running and plotting instantiated networks, and provides methods for training reservoir-models.

Also, check out the notebooks. Especially experiments/hass_replication/esn.py, where we replicate an Echo State Network and train the network to reliably sustain a sine wave.
